# Rekordbox reader for Windows, macOS
**Reads rekordbox decks values from memory**

This repository contains a macOS and a Windows c++ project to read rekordbox internals.
The project goal is to solve those ones problems, who bought a beginner pionner's dj controller like the and still want to get the time codes of the current played song like on the expensive ones.

I only have DDJ-FLX4 so the project only tested them mentioned device and rekordbox version (6.6.8).

I also included a Node.js project, so you can check which controller events has been implemented so far.
See the projects description in their respective folder.

If you need more features, feel free to create a new issue about it.
